## 4. Implementation Analysis

### 4.1 Bit-Level Optimization Details
```python
# Key optimization constants
phi_bits = 0x3FF7154769768  # Binary representation of φ
scale = 0x5F375A86          # Lomont's constant

# Fast phase calculation
phase_approx = (idx >> 45) & 0x7FF
phase = (phase_approx * scale) >> 28
```
