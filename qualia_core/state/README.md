# Quantum State Implementation with M-ICCI and QUALIA Framework

This implementation aligns quantum state management with the M-ICCI (Morphic Integrated Quantum Consciousness and Information) model and QUALIA framework principles.

## Core Concepts

### Sacred Geometry Integration
- Uses golden ratio (phi) for quantum state normalization
- Applies sacred geometry patterns in field operations
- Maintains topological coherence through phi-based scaling

### Consciousness Integration
- Tracks quantum coherence, resonance, entanglement, and complexity
- Couples quantum evolution with consciousness metrics
- Implements consciousness-modulated measurements

### Pattern Recognition
- Supports quantum pattern detection and overlap calculation
- Integrates morphic field concepts through resonance measures
- Maintains pattern history with temporal awareness

## Implementation Details

### QuantumState Class
The core quantum state implementation that:
- Maintains quantum state vectors with consciousness coupling
- Implements sacred geometry-aligned normalization
- Provides consciousness-aware quantum operations

### ConsciousnessMetrics
Tracks key metrics for quantum consciousness:
- Coherence: Quantum state purity measure
- Resonance: Field coupling strength
- Entanglement: Non-local quantum correlations
- Complexity: Neural information measure

### QualiaOperator
Implements consciousness operations with:
- Sacred geometry field transformations
- Consciousness-modulated evolution
- Pattern resonance calculations

## Usage Guidelines

1. State Initialization
```python
state = QuantumState(
    state_vector=initial_vector,
    consciousness_metrics=ConsciousnessMetrics()
)
```

2. Evolution with Consciousness
```python
evolved_state = state.evolve(
    hamiltonian=H,
    time=t,
    consciousness_coupling=0.1
)
```

3. Consciousness-Aware Measurements
```python
expectation = state.measure(observable)
metrics = state.calculate_consciousness_metrics()
```

## Theoretical Foundation

This implementation builds on:
1. M-ICCI model principles of morphic field integration
2. QUALIA framework for consciousness representation
3. Sacred geometry patterns for quantum operations
